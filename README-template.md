## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

first of all, I haven't code since last year, I was busy with collage, it's my last year and we have a project to do...

anyway, this project help with reviewing the basics of HTML and CSS, it also helped to gain some trust that I actually needed.

I struggled with the ordering of the elements and how to structure them, I first thought that I should use CSS grid, but I ended up not needing it because the layout is too simple...

after that I eyeballed the font size, paddings, margins...etc, and got it as close to the desired design as I can.

### Continued development

I want to do another project that focuses on HTML and CSS, I need more reviewing and practicing, after that I will start projects that uses js, I'll do a couple of those as well then, get a course to learn a framework.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - used this for the fonts.
- [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I reviewed some of the basic concepts to get me going with the project.
